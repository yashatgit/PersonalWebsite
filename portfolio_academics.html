                            KinectoTherapy uses <a href="http://www.xbox.com/kinect" target="_new">Microsoft Kinect's</a> <strong>motion
                            sensing technology</strong> to create an <strong>Intelligent Motor-Rehabilitation system</strong> which gamifies
                            the exercise routines and provides effective feedback. The aim of this project is to make the unexciting
                            rehabilitation process fun and rewarding by incorporating suitable motion-sensing serious games.
                        </p>

                        <p>Conventional rehabilitation is strenuous and monotonous and a physically challenged person needs to feel
                            motivated throughout to benefit from the process. Games make users feel engaged but popular games (1) lack
                            essential components for rehabilitation. Attempts have been made to develop appropriate rehabilitation games (2)
                            but they lack entertainment and engaging qualities.
                            KinectoTherapy is a motor rehabilitation tool that mixes useful elements of both (1&2) creating meaningful play
                            and can be used for all age-groups.<br>
                        </p>

                        <p>KinectoTherapy was demonstarted in Microsoft Imagine Cup 2012 (India) competition under
                            ‘Accessibility’ category and was <strong>adjudged second in the National Finals</strong>.
                            The project has also got <strong>wide Media Coverage</strong> in forms of News-Paper articles, Journal articles
                            and was aired on CNBC TV18's show Young Turks.
                        </p>

                        <p>As a student still pursuing my undergraduates, I had the opportunity to go through the placement fair in my
                            college and found that most students were found lacking in their knowledge of algorithms. Algorithms form a
                            basis of recruitment for any good company but learning them is, at times, difficult and uninteresting. Through
                            this site, we plan to build a community which aims at <strong>making algorithms a 'fun to learn'
                                activity</strong> but at the sametime is accurate and to the point using some of the visual element
                            properties that we have integrated in the platform we are building.
                        </p>

                        <p>As algorithms need a more hands on approach, the site has a completely new method of <strong>Interaction using
                            properties of the HTML 5 Canvas</strong> and will not depend on videos, a trend which is quite visible in
                            today's online correspondence classes. It also host a Text To Speech (TTS) converter. The advantages of these
                            features are clear, it provides a more internationalized way of presenting information to students, and topics
                            which face the problem of 'visualization' can be easily addressed to by making <strong>visual elements and
                                interactions</strong> which are supported on the HTML5 canvas. The site is open to the public for creating
                            and editing pre-existing slideshows. I always believed that teaching and learning is a collaborative affair and
                            this product heavily inclines on this ideology.
                        </p>

                        <p>Currently, we are planning to support algorithms; however the same technology can be used to support a wide
                            variety of educational courses.
                        </p>

                        <p>My work in this project has been to ideate and to figure out the feasibility and limitations of the project along
                            with designing and developing a front end which users can relate to. Since this is a relatively new method of
                            creating presentations for teaching, we adopted the Ajile methodology towards making this product and have made
                            significant progress in developing the product. Algorythmus is in its first alpha stage.

                        <p>This project basically focuses on maximizing the learning curve of a student using interactive digital world as a
                            medium. <br>We created 2 motion sensing games based on <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Kinect/"
                                                                                      target="_new">Microsoft Kinect technology</a>. The aim
                            of these Kinect-enabled games is to help children learn or gain knowledge of a literature book through natural
                            use of their body to play games. Kinect is a controller free, full body motion sensing gadget by Microsoft. This
                            has been used along with a PC or a laptop running windows to play a game on the system using your own body as a
                            controller.
                            <br>This project is sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University (Pennsylvania) and the hosting site is <a

                        <p>Use of Kinect to play a game is a good approach since the target users of this games are children in their 5th or
                            6th grade. Children in such age are very active and would prefer to have physical activities as compared to
                            sitting down and learning. The games takes advantage of this fact and is an approach to use that activeness in
                            such a way that it is useful for both learning and tries to make education more relevant through entering into
                            their favorite field.
                            Till date, we have sucessfully completed 2 games based on the novels '<a
                                href="http://gordonkorman.com/kidnap1.htm" target="_new">Kidnapped</a>' and '<a

                            runs till date. Our aim is to see how useful/effective these games are
                            when compared to the generic educational games present in the market today in terms of visualisation of the
                            story/scenes and the overall literature/science learning objectives.

                            <br>We followed a human-centered design process, in which we consulted experienced local English teachers on our
                            instructional and game designs. By field-testing with multiple communities, we observed user behaviors with the
                            technology that generalize across settings. Through ethnographic studies, we also studied how social factors
                            such as gender and caste affected MILLEE gameplay in everyday rural environments. </p>

                        <p><strong>Game genre:</strong>
                        	This is a first player role playing game which lays emphasises on recycling and proper utilisation of resources. 
                        	The player is taught the importance of recycling and reusing of resources.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Scenario:</strong>
                        	The year is 2030 and due to depletion of resources on Earth, many humans are shifting to other celestial bodies for survival. 
                        	The game world consists of such an inhabited colony on Moon which is filled up of space waste and debris which needs to be 
                        	cleaned up for human settlement. In course of his journey, the player also has to bring back important objects like parts of 
                        	space shuttle and satellite -which are scattered all over the place- to the base so that they can be recycled and used again.
                        	The game lays emphasis on recycling of different materials in order to ensure minimisation of waste as well as to increase the 
                        	re-usage of a variety of objects. The player has to understand the importance of recycling and reuse of materials so that 
                        	the natural resources are utilised efficiently and understand and learn important aspects of waste management.

                        		<li>The player has to destroy all the harmful radioactive waste found in the course using his plasma gun.</li>
                        		<li>Player will have to search for reusable materials and bring them back on the base for recycling purpose.</li>

                        <strong>Vision Statement</strong>: To develop a unique High mobility solution which is Scalable, affordable and have
                        a mass impact in a country undergoing transition with a large population and limited resources.<br>

                        Our team developed an <strong>Emergency Response Decision System</strong>. More emphasis was laid on the
                        &quot;<strong>Golden hour</strong>&quot; (–it refers to a time period lasting from a few minutes to several hours
                        following traumatic injury being sustained by a casualty, during which there is the highest likelihood that prompt
                        medical treatment will prevent death).<br>
                        The final end products were:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Design of a company (read ABC medical service) along with a business proposal with detailed market
                                analysis.
                            </li>

                        The aim of this project was to <strong>control a desktop or a Laptop with a simple remote</strong>, like the one we
                        already use for our TV-set. The buttons in the remote can be configured to either start applications, swap between
                        windows, flip pages during presentations, turning off the system and many more. Almost any application that uses
                        shortcut keys and mouse can be controlled using this setup.<br>

                        The conventional Infrared TV Remotes communicates via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC-5">RC5 protocol</a>.
                        Exploiting the full duplex propert of the Sound card, we created a small Infrared reciever which transmitted the
                        decoded signal to the Computer via 'Microphone input port'. On recording the pulse sent from the Remote using <a
                            href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_new">Audacity</a>, we found the following manchester code for
                        'Menu' button:<br>

                        </p>


                        <p>Following this, we implemented an algorithm in Matlab which
                            simulated the working of an TSOP to decode the signal for respective key pulse by recording 3 sec of pulse sent
                            from the remote.</p>

                        <p>This Python - OpenGL algorithm enables <strong>visualizing 2-D images in a 3-Dimensional perspective</strong>. It
                            takes in an image and extracts the position and colour of all the non-white pixels from the image. It then
                            creates a unit cube in 3-Dimensional space for each non-white pixel extracted. The cubes are then appended
                            together and the image can then be displayed as a 3-D solid formed from the cubes. The camera angle is
                            initialised in such a manner that when the program executes the user can actually see the raised building like
                            structures formed by converting the 2-D image into 3-D.<br>
                            To give the final output a realistic feel, a texture-mapped plane was added that served as a floor beneath the
                            image in 3-D space. Functionalities have been added to the keyboard that allows the user to move the camera
                            angle in various ways. The instructions for using the camera with the help of the keyboard keys are displayed in
                            a window that is made by using the 'Tkinter' GUI library supported by Python.</p>

                        <p><strong>Concepts and Techniques Used:</strong><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data Visualization in 3D:</li>
                            <p> The program takes a 2D image with white background. It then extracts all the non-white pixels and creates a
                                3D world made of cubes.
                                We used the gameobject.vertices3 module to draw objects in 3D. All the methods provided by this class have
                                been used to draw and render the cubes in 3D.</p>


                            <li>Complex model-Navigation and Viewing:</li>
                            <p>We have used the gameobject.matrix44 module to implement the camera movement in 3D space. As soon as a key is
                                pressed to rotate/move the camera, the rotation/movement direction is incremented or decremented by 1 unit.
                                <br/>
                                Rotation matrix is then calculated and <u>multiplied</u> by the camera matrix whereas the movement values
                                are <u>added</u> into the camera matrix. The time between 2 consecutive key presses is recorded and
                                multiplied with the rotation and camera matrix to move the camera in the 3D space.<br/>


                            <li>Texture mapping:</li>
                            <p>To give the 3-D word a realistic feel, a texture has been mapped onto the floor over which the Cubes
                                corresponding to the image are placed.</p>

                            <li>Lighting:</li>
                            <p>As the camera moves away from a set of cubes, their colour diminishes by a little extent to make the lighting
                                realistic. There are three light colours for each light- Ambient, Diffused and Specular and four (add
                                Emission to the list) for each surface. The light parameters are set by glLight and the surface light
                                parameters are set by glMaterial. Only one light source (LIGHT0) has been enabled and
                                used.<strong> </strong></p>

                        The Playpower Foundation is using a US$12 computer as a platform for <strong>8-bit learning games</strong> in order
                        to improve educational access for millions of children around the world. Motivated by the availability of this
                        radically affordable platform, the goal is to design and discover high-quality 8-bit learning games and <strong>make
                        computer-aided learning affordable for people everywhere</strong>.<br>
                        The games are developed for 8-bit gaming consoles that are currently sold in dozens of developing countries for as
                        little as $10.

                        <p>The Alternate Shopper basically addresses the problem of &quot;consumerism&quot; and supports &quot;Alternate
                            economy&quot;. It gives the user options for buying their requirements from places like local stores. Along with
                            this it supports the &quot;Alternate economy&quot; movement and, with time, it will create a gathering of people
                            supporting this movement. It is a portal which gives the user the option to select the best local product
                            nearby.</p>

                        <p>The aim is to decrease the consumption of mass produced goods by &quot;providing consumers with different and
                            better alternatives&quot; prepared in small-scale-industries or local shops. Doing so we promote the idea of
                            &quot;Alternate Economy&quot;<br/>
                            In this fast life, people don't have the time to search for a place which will supply the best quality of
                            product they need. So they end up going in a supermarket or a shopping mall which thrives on mass produced
                            goods. So here the idea fits into the need. It provides the user with different choice to shop rather than the
                            conventional supermarket choice.</p>

                        <p><strong>Importance of Alternate shopper:</strong></p>

                        <p>The rules of economy at present strongly support mass production. The economy however is money centric something
                            that has made the developed countries what they are today. However what they failed to realize was that post
                            development, the development of the larger part of the society also gains equal significance. However this is
                            not what the economy supports. With mass production they take away the employment of many locals who could have
                            earned a living out of their own local business. Come to think of it, with the increase in the local businesses
                            there will be a definite decrease in the consumption of mass produced products.<br/>
                            The idea is to build a web portal which will grow on the inputs provided by the people. To be more precise, It's
                            a portal or a search engine which gives you the required groceries in a place near you rather then supermarkets
                            or shops with mass produced goods. The code for the plan is &quot;Aim for the local business but never sacrifice
                            on the quality&quot;. Hence it lists down the places based on the reviews of the place (given by the
                            people!).<br/>
                            The app. also allows you to comment, give feedback or &quot;favorite&quot; a place. It also hosts a shopping
                            list space where you can put up your local shopping list and help the locals around you. You login and you have
                            access to all of this and more articles, debates etc about &quot;Alternate Economy&quot; and similar topics
                            which are present on the site. The site acts like a database collecting people who support this movement and who
                            knowingly or unknowingly, but with the help of the app, want to decrease the consumption of mass produced goods.
                            This app. leads to a site (read-the web portal) that is active about uniting the people together as a force as
                            with numbers come strength and with this strength we can visualize a city-wide and slowly a country-wide
                            decrement in the consumption of mass produced good. The app. is the beginner the site is the final step.</p>

                        <p><strong>Mobile App Design:</strong></p>

                        <p>It basically starts with an application on your cell or PC. It asks you a basic question &quot;What do you want
                            to shop?&quot; and &quot;Where are you most likely to visit?&quot;, like for example you want to shop for some
                            grocery and you give in &quot;BigBazaar/or any other super market&quot;. The app basically gives you options
                            that are local to the place where you are shopping (in same radius) and which work on a private or individual
                            level. It also gives in other basic info as in &quot;Benefits of buying from this store&quot; along with basic
                            information regarding the store and its quality.</p>

                        <p>Now as stated earlier, it gives you the best local option nearby, which is provided by the &quot;favorite&quot;
                            option. Here the user himself based upon his experiences rates the place. On searching, the place rated the most
                            is featured first on the list. Another feature is &quot;Add new Alternative places&quot; which allows different
                            users to add new places to the database. Additional space is given for each place so that people can give their
                            opinion about the place.</p>

                        <p> Sample screenshots of the App:</p>

                        <p><strong>Bhookh Mitane Wala (BMW)</strong> is an eating joint in IIM Ahmedabad. The aim of this project was also
                            to establish the Identity of this new eating joint. As almost all of the customers to BMW are college students,
                            all the designs were made which would appeal to them.<br>
